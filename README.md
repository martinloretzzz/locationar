# LOCATIONAR

## Introduction

Readme under construction...

Simple Location based Argumented Reality library, based on the [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API), [Geolocation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API), [DeviceOrientation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Detecting_device_orientation) and [AmbientLightSensor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AmbientLightSensor)

But you can do a lot of other things to, like:
-building a [compass](https://0b01001101.github.io/locationar/examples/compass.html) with DeviceOrientation
-light your three.js scenes depending on the ambient light
-others

The lib is small, only 12.5KB/3.8KB gzipped

## Usage

LOCATIONAR is provided as an npm module:

```
npm install locationar
```

You can also download this repository and import the dist/LOCATIONAR.js file
